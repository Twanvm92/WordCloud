# WordCloud
This is some python code that generates a Wordcloud by reading a textfile, cleaning the data (remove punctation etc.), leave out a list of stopwords and extract the 10 most common words from the text.

I did this as a small assignment for the course [**Python for Data Science**](https://www.edx.org/course/python-for-data-science "Python for Data Science")
